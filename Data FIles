Lemmatization with NLTK :
	-> i hate the NLTK API but it's would be fun
	-> The lematization is the way to have standards words like better : good. The lemme of better is good.
	-> it's usefull because with one string we could get a list and convert this list in set to remove all occurences of a word.
